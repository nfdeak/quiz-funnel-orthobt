# quiz-funnel — OrthoBelt

High-converting quiz funnel for OrthoBelt (lower back / SI joint pain product).

**Stack:** Next.js 16 · TypeScript · Tailwind CSS · Framer Motion

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Analytics

The quiz writes analytics directly to Supabase from the browser. This is compatible with the repo's static export setup.

For scalable dashboard reads, the analytics page now uses Supabase SQL functions instead of loading the full raw event table into the browser.

Set the analytics environment in your app config:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_ANALYTICS_ENV=dev
```

Recommended values:

- `dev` for local work
- `preview` for staging/preview deploys
- `prod` for production

One-time Supabase step:

1. Open SQL Editor in Supabase.
2. Run `supabase/analytics_functions.sql`.

Tracked quiz events now include `locale`, and the dashboard can filter by locale.

The dashboard defaults to `prod` so local/dev traffic does not pollute the main view.

Inspect analytics in the browser:

```bash
http://localhost:3000/analytics
```

Canonical localized quiz routes:

- `/orthobelt-us`
- `/orthogurtel-de`

Run the terminal report:

```bash
npm run analyze:survey
```

Remove the manual test row if needed:

```sql
delete from public.quiz_events
where session_id = 'manual-test-session';
```
